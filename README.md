## üéØ Demo Data

The demo includes:

- **10,000 simulated alumni donors** with realistic demographics
- **70% concentration** in target zip codes (29680, 29650, 29607, 29681)
- **Graduation years**: 1990-2024 with age-correlated donation patterns
- **Donation ranges**: $25-$50K annual, $100-$500K cumulative
- **20 event venues** across multiple categories
- **H3 spatial indexing** at resolutions 7, 8, and 9 (calculated in Python)

### Data Distribution

**Geographic Coverage**: Uses zip code filtering (not city names) for reliable targeting across Greenville County, SC.

| Geographic Area | Zip Codes | Target % | Donor Count | 
|----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Primary Target | 29680, 29650, 29607, 29681 | 70% | ~7,000 |
| Greenville County | 29601-29690 (30+ zip codes) | 30% | ~3,000 |

**Why Zip Codes vs. City Names**: 
- More reliable geographic boundaries
- Consistent data formatting
- Avoids city name variations in address data

## üîß Technical Details

### H3 Indexing
- Uses Uber's H3 hierarchical hexagonal indexing system
- **Streamlit in Snowflake**: Native H3 functions (`H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL_STRING`, `H3_CELL_TO_BOUNDARY_WKT`)
- **Standalone Python**: H3 calculations performed in Python for portability
- Enables efficient spatial aggregation and analysis
- Supports multiple resolution levels (7-9) for different use cases

### Snowflake Integration
- Leverages Snowflake's native geospatial functions
- Uses marketplace data for realistic address geocoding
- Creates materialized tables (not views) for optimal performance
- Optimized queries for large-scale data processing

### Visualization Stack
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application framework
- **PyDeck**: Native H3 hexagon visualization with H3HexagonLayer
- **Plotly**: Advanced charting and mapping capabilities
- **Folium**: Interactive maps with tooltips and overlays (standalone app)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: PDF report generation (standalone app)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Map Display Issues

**üî¥ Enhanced Markers instead of True Hexagons?**
- **NEW SOLUTION**: App now uses PyDeck H3HexagonLayer for native hexagon visualization!
- **Look for**: "Creating TRUE H3 hexagons using PyDeck" success message in the app
- **If enhanced markers**: PyDeck may not be available in your environment
- **Automatic fallback**: App falls back to enhanced circular markers if PyDeck fails
- **Best option**: PyDeck provides true H3 polygons without Snowflake boundary functions

**üî¥ No map geography showing?**
- Try `white-bg` map style (no external dependencies)
- Corporate firewalls often block map tile servers
- Consider using standalone app instead of SiS

**üî¥ PyDeck Serialization Errors?**
- Error: "vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute"
- **Fixed**: App now converts all data to basic Python types before PyDeck
- If persists: Check for pandas/numpy objects in your data

**üî¥ HTML Rendering Issues (Map Legends)?**
- **Problem**: Raw HTML code showing instead of formatted content
- **Fixed**: Now using Streamlit native components (expanders, columns) instead of complex HTML
- **Result**: Map legends display properly in all environments

**üî¥ Map Image Download Not Working?**
- **Streamlit in Snowflake**: Image downloads typically don't work due to environment restrictions
- **Standalone App**: Requires `pip install kaleido` for image generation
- **Alternative**: Use browser screenshot or the comprehensive text report with recreation instructions
- **Error "h3_resolution not defined"**: Fixed - variable now properly scoped for both map types

### Common Issues

1. **Snowflake Connection Errors**:
   - Verify account identifier format (`account.region.provider`)
   - Check username/password in secrets.toml
   - Ensure user has necessary permissions

2. **Missing Marketplace Data**:
   - Install "US Addresses & POI" from Snowflake Marketplace
   - Verify data is available at `US_POINTS_OF_INTEREST__ADDRESSES.cybersyn.us_addresses`
   - Update database references in SQL scripts if your path differs

3. **Package Installation Issues**:
   - Use Python 3.8+ (some dependencies require recent versions)
   - Consider using conda for complex dependencies like h3

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Adjust warehouse size in Snowflake for faster queries
   - Use filtering to reduce data volume for visualization

5. **H3 Visualization**:
   - **NEW**: Both versions now use PyDeck H3HexagonLayer for true hexagon visualization
   - **SiS Version**: H3 aggregation via Snowflake functions (`H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL_STRING`)
   - **Standalone Version**: Uses Python `h3>=3.7.0` library for H3 calculations
   - **Test PyDeck**: Run `python test_pydeck_h3.py` to verify PyDeck functionality
   - **Fallback**: Apps automatically fall back to enhanced markers if PyDeck fails
   - Run `debug_h3_functions.sql` to test Snowflake H3 availability
   - Use `verify_h3_setup.sql` to check if your data has H3 columns

6. **"Truth value of an array" Errors**:
   - Pandas/numpy arrays used in boolean contexts
   - **Fixed**: Improved array handling with proper `.tolist()` and `.dropna()` methods
   - Apps now gracefully handle empty dataframes and missing H3 data

### Getting Help

- Check Snowflake documentation for marketplace data setup
- Review Streamlit documentation for deployment options
- Verify H3 installation for spatial indexing features
